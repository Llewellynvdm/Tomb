Minimalistic command line tool based on Linux dm-crypt and LUKS, trusted by hackers since 2007.

You can keep your volumes secure and easily manageable with simple commands.

Create a new 120MiB `secret.tomb` folder and lock it with a new `secret.tomb.key` file.
```
 $ tomb dig   -s 120 secret.tomb
 $ tomb forge -k secret.tomb.key
 $ tomb lock  -k secret.tomb.key secret.tomb
```
To open it, do
```
 $ tomb open  -k secret.tomb.key secret.tomb
```
And after you are done
```
 $ tomb close
```
Or, if you are in a hurry, kill all processes with open files inside your tomb and close it.
```
 $ tomb slam
```
